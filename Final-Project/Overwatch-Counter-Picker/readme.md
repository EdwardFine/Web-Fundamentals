For my final project I wanted to start with something that my friends could use for their benefit. I decided on this because I have fairly good knowledge about different
overwatch matchups and they would constantly ask me for who to pick against X, Y, or Z and I couldn't find a good spot online that had that updated information.
So I created this website. The final version is different that the original idea. Originally the matchups were below the heroes, rather than the right side of the screen, I found this to be frustrating because of all the scrolling to pick a hero and see the matchup. Also originally, the website had 4 columns, counters, countered by, counter each other, and no effect. I thought that having more columns would give me more freedom to better catagorize the characters, but it only made them harder. I made the choice to remove counter each other and no effect first, but then while filling those two columns up, some heroes were sifted into counters when they weren't really a hard counter so I adapted the columns once more to strong against and weak against and changed the whole website from counters to matchups.
